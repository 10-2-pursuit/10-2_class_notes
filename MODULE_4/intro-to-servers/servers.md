- Why are they important?

- Describe the parts of this HTTP response
``` 
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 03 Jan 2019 23:26:07 GMT
Server: gws
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 68894
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

<!doctype html><html> 
```

- Describe what happens when you visit a webpage through your browser. Assume that some data will need to be recalled from a database.


## Let's Explore Web Apps!

### Goal:
To dive into popular web applications and understand how they connect with servers.

### Here's What You'll Do:

1. **Breakout** 
   - In breakout rooms, choose a driver and presenter.
   - Your room will share the name of  a well-known web app - think Instagram, Pinterest, Twi-err uh X

2. **Dig Deeper!**
   - Head to your virtual breakout rooms.
   - What type of HTTP methods are used?
   - Delve into the types of resources the server sends back to the user (like images, text, profiles).
   - Also, think about the various types of HTTP requests that are made within the app to even make those requests
3. **Consider Resources** 
    - What 'resrouces' would need to be tracked in a database for this app?
    - If each resource had its own database, how many databases would we need?
    - Do any resources _belong to any other resources_?  How would we handle that?

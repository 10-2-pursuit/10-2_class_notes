# Brudtr App Project Survival Guide

## Setting Expectations

The Brudtr App Project is designed to enhance your web development skills, focusing on both backend (Node.js & Express) and frontend (React) technologies. By creating an application to manage transactions, you'll demonstrate your ability to handle data, build user interfaces, and manage routes effectively.

## Key Concepts and Tips

- **Project Structure**: Plan your project's structure, deciding whether to start with the backend or frontend. Consider organizing files, creating RESTful routes, and managing components.  
- **Progressive Development**: Start with basic features and gradually add complexity. Test each component and route as you gousing Postman.
- **Version Control**: Commit your code regularly to track changes and manage your work efficiently. Push often!
- **Seek Help**: This project is meant to challenge you. Reach out for assistance if you're stuck, whether from instructors or via the #help_code Slack channel.

## Steps to Complete the Brudtr App Project

Follow this structured approach to successfully complete the Brudtr App project:

1. **Project Setup**
   - Create a new React application using `Vite`.
   - Set up a backend server using Node.js and Express.
   - Initialize a Git repository for your front end.
   - Initialize a seperate Git repo for your backend.


2. **Plan Routes and Database**
   - Define the RESTful routes for transactions (index, show, create, update, delete).
   - Define your data.  What keys and values will be required.
   - Create a Data folder and initialize data.

3. **Backend Development**
   - Start with backend development. Create routes, controllers, and models for transactions.
   - Implement CRUD operations for transactions (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
   - Test each with Postman.

4. **Frontend Development**
   - Begin building the frontend. Design components and plan their hierarchy.
   - Create wireframe for each view.
   - Create views for each RESTful route

5. **Styling and UI**
   - Apply CSS styles to create a visually appealing user interface.
   - Ensure user interactions are intuitive and mobile responsive.

6. **Deployment**
   - Deployment walkthrough will happen on Wednesday 10/18.  

Remember to commit your code after each feature is built and tested. Seek assistance whenever needed, and aim to complete at least 70% of the project for a passing grade.

Good luck, and happy coding! 🚀👨‍💻👩‍💻

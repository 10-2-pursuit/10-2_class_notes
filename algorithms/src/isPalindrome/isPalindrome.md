# Is Palindrome

## Problem 

Write a  function `isPalindrome` that takes a string as input and returns `true` if the string is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

For example, the strings "racecar" and "Madam" are palindromes, while "hello" and "OpenAI" are not.

For this problem - assume that the string will be one single word without any special characters or numbers.  


## Testing

To test your function, _**navigate to the algorithms directory**_ and run:

```
npm install

npm test isPalindrome.test.js
```

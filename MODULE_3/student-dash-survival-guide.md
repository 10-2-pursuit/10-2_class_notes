# React Portfolio Project Survival Guide

## Setting Expectations

The React Portfolio Project is designed to enhance your web development skills using **React**. By creating an interactive portfolio website, you will demonstrate your ability to build dynamic user interfaces and effectively manage data.

## Key Concepts and Tips

- **Strategic Planning**: Plan your project's structure and component hierarchy before coding.
- **Progressive Development**: Start with a basic version and gradually add features as you progress.
- **Commit Regularly**: Frequent commits help you track changes and manage your work efficiently.
- **Test Everything Constantly**: Write some code, log the result.  In order to develop the app you must be testing each piece of code as you go.
- **Seek Help**: This project is meant to be challenging.  Completion fo 70% is considered a passing grade.  If you are stuck and need assistance you  _must_ reach out for help to you instructors or va the #help_code slack channel

## Steps to Complete the React Portfolio Project

Follow this structured approach to successfully complete your React portfolio project:

1. **Project Setup**
   - Create a new React application using `vite`.
   - Establish a GitHub repository to manage your project's version control.

2. **Data Integration**
   - Study the provided JSON data (`src/data/data.json`).
   - Determine how to incorporate this data into your portfolio's content.

3. **Plan Out Your Components**
    - Determine how many components should be needed
    - Determine hierarchy - which components are children and of what
    - Determine Props - which componnets will pas what props to which children
    - Create a visual diagram of this complete with data flow

4. **Plan State**
    - Determine which components require state - determine initial values
    - Determine state change functioanlity - what needs to be changed 
    - Plan lifting of state - which child components will update the parent component state
    - Add this to your component diagram

4. **Build**
    - Create application one component at a time
    - Render components first for strucutre without any functionality
    - Create components using dummy data in order to test functionality as you go
    - Commit after each feature is built and tested
    

5. **Deployment**
   - Deploy your completed React portfolio to a web hosting service.
   - Update your repository's `readme.md` with clear deployment instructions.

In-Class Activity: Building a Case Study & Developing a Prototype

Today, we're going to dive into the world of app analysis and creation. We have two exciting activities that will help you gain a deeper understanding of popular apps and how to plan and build a competitive app prototype. Let's get started!

# Activity 1: Building a Case Study


Slack
A messaging platform that allows users to create communities to communicate with fellow coworkers / classmates 

Discord -  as a competitor - built for GAMERS - designed for social communication via audio - "An uprade from teamspeak"

Create a case study for your chosen app by answering these questions:

end goal "what your platform will be used overall" 
"A direction for functionalities"

What is this product's vision? - 
To facilitate professional communcation and build community engagement by streamlining text conversations between peers

Who is the target customer?
Proffesionals - the workplace!

What customer problem does it solve?
communication - As companies became digital we needed a way for professionals to communicate without passing  a MEMO(memorandum) on paper and pen PROTOCOL -
Slack streamlines and organizes professional communications 

Why is this problem important?
Efficient communication saves MONEY; 
Time === money && resources;
What were customers doing before the product existed?
Memos and Emails (and even sending documents through pneumatic tubes) or riding horses - email or physical copies

How does this product compare to the alternatives?
Teams - outdated, slow, not optimized, cant upload files, "I hate it" - Jalal

Determine if this app is generally safe to use.
Chats gave admins, salesForce owns slack and monitors traffic, we have teams monitoring data

How would you monetize this app?
We charge a subscription fee to the bosses

After discussing within your groups, submit your answers to the class Slack so that everyone gets a chance to share their work. We'll choose 1-2 groups to discuss their case study with the class.

# Activity 2: Developing a Prototype

Imagine you have one week to build a competitive app prototype for a popular app. Let's choose one as a class:

What technologies would you use?
 
React => front end Web  notSlack.com
ReactNative => front end phone notSlack
DB => Postgress SQL;
GraphQL;
Express/Rust/C++;


What technologies might you have to learn to build the prototype?

ReactNative => front end phone notSlack
DB => Postgress SQL;
GraphQL;
Express/Rust/C++/Python/Ruby;
OAuth
Docker
CI/CD

What are the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) features that are possible to build in a week?

1. a user can CRUD comments /posts
2. a user can CRUD channels
3. a user can upload files
4. a user can search/retreive old chats
5. a user can log in
6. a user can determine who is added to a channel

What are realistic milestones for each day of the week?

full crud one week;
filtering/ search;
authentication;



What other strategies do you use to help plan and build apps?
Pair programming - 
Whiteboards - common use componnets - good component arcchetctuooor;
Wireframe Trello,

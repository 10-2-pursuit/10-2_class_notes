## Today's Lab
[React State Forms](https://github.com/10-2-pursuit/lab-react-forms/)

Sure, here's an updated version of the table with a mention of state in the form:

### Quick Reference

<div style="display: flex;  border:2px solid">
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Basic Concept</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1. Controlled Components</td>
      <td>Components where form data is controlled by React state.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2. Uncontrolled Components</td>
      <td>Components where form data is managed by the DOM.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3. Event Handling</td>
      <td>Handling form input events like onChange, onSubmit, etc.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4. Form Submission</td>
      <td>Handling form submission and sending data to a server.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5. State Management</td>
      <td>Using React state to hold form data and update it on user input.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>6. Input Types</td>
      <td>Various input types like text, number, checkbox, radio, etc.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

Now, we have included "State Management" as a concept in the table, which highlights the usage of React state to hold and manage form data, especially in the context of controlled components. This addition emphasizes the importance of using state for form handling in React applications.

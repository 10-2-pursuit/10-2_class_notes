# Portfolio Project

## Setting Expectations
This project will test what he have learned so far about `HTML`, `CSS` and `DOM manipulation` and combine it with `fetch()` and the consuming of an exterior `API`

If you are stuck, or need help it is __essential__ that you __ask for help__.  

__You must Own Your Pursuit__ .  If you do not understand a topic, this is where we learn it.

## Tips 
- commit every hour or more with expressive messages: _adds css grid to index.html_
-  _Measure twice cut once_ - design an app before building an app. 
- `console.log()` every step of the way _especially when working with the API_
- do not copy code from the lecture notes - look at the lecture notes and _write_ your own code;
- AI can be your friend on this _just don't cheat yourself_

## Steps to Complete the Portfolio Project

Below is a helpful guide to assist in organizing your working process.


1. **Project Setup**
   - Create a new GitHub repository for the inventory app.
   - Create an `index.html` file and a separate `styles.css` file in the project directory.
   - Set up a basic HTML structure in the `index.html` file.
   - add some basic stlye and simple `console.log()` to ensure your files are connected

2. **API Selection**
    - Decide on a an API you find intereting that is open (no API key requried) and easy to access.
    - Using Postman and the API Docs, make queries to observe the response from your api
    - Decide the following:
        * What API endpoints will you Query?
        * What will you display to your user?
3.  **App Design**
    - Create user stories.  Example:
        * As a user, I can see a landing page with a list of recipees
        * As a user, when I click a recipee I am routed to a page with details about that recipee 
        * As a user, I can enter information about a recipee I want and am shown recipee matching my input 
    - Decide you file structure. 
        * What HTML pages will I require (minimum two)?
        * How are they connected?
        * What data will need to be passed to each page?
        * Which pages will consume the API?
        * Which page(s) will handle user input?
    - Design your files
        * Make a basic wireframe for each page.
        * How will you display information?
        * Create a template funciton to do so. 
2. **HTML Structure**
    - Create your HTML files
    - Link your files together
    - Create forms to handle user input.  
3. **API**
    - Connect to your API.  Console log results at first.
    - Populate the API to the DOM in a way that you prefer.
    - Connect your form.  Test it.
    - Connect your form to your API.  Test it.
    - Connect your form to your API and populate to the DOM.
    - Create error handling logic for your form in the case of bad data.  Test it.

5. **Styling**
   - Open the `styles.css` file and link it to your `index.html` file using the `<link>` tag.
   - Decide on your grid - how will you display your columns.
   - Choose a color scheme for your applicaiton. 
   - Utilize CSS Grid to create a two-column or greater layout for the page.
   - Apply cohesive and professional styling to the elements, making use of the specified colors.
   - Create proper media queries to update our display for secific screen sizes.
6. **Readme && Deployment**
    - Create a readme.md file that explains your project.  
    - List API used and any extra technlogies 
    - Deploy to Github Pages

# CRUD Project


### Steps To Success

1. **Project Initialization**
   - Set up the project directory and initialize a new Node.js project.
   - Install necessary dependencies, if any.

2. **File Organization**
   - Organize the project files into directories.
   - `src` for our code.
   - `data` for our data.
   - `helpers` for our helpers.
   -  set up `npm scripts`


3. **Design Data and Connect Files**
   - Define your data - often times a `models` folder will hold different files for each data type in our application as an example.
   - Create a JSON data file that your app will read and write to. Usually initialzed with an empty array

4. **Create Helper Functions**
   - Implement helper functions for reading and writing data.
   - Utilize the built-in `fs` module for file operations.
   - Create controller file for CRUD logic

5. **Set Up Index.js**
   - Grab user input
   - determine the desired CRUD operation.
   - Build switch logic

6. **Build CRUD functionality**
   - Build  CRUD; Keep in mind, once one CRUD action is complete the others are very similar

7. **Invoke Controller Functions**
   - Import necessary functions from the controller file.
   - Invoke the corresponding controller function based on user input.

 By following these steps you should be able to create a command line application.

## Tips 
- Plan your work - If you ask for help and have no Pseudocode our response is going to be 'pseudocode your steps'

- Do your own work.  If you copy code you may move forward but you will not learn what you need to suceed in the next module

- Log each step.  Import some data? console.log() it.  Capture user input? console.log() it.  Import a function?  Console.log() it.  This is the only way we can see what is happening in our work.

- Read your error messages.  Google any messages and take note of the error type and the file that is throwing it;

- Watch your Imports/exports
- Watch for spelling mistakes
- Watch for capitalization

- #HelpCode on slack is your friend.  Also please remember to ask for help if you need with properly formatted questions
    - What is your problem
    - What is expected behavior?
    - What is actually happening?
    - What have you done to solve it.

- Commit OFTEN.  We can see your commits and can tell if you need help.  Commit at least every hour of work.

Ya'll got this.

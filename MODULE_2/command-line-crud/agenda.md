## Command Line Crud
During this lesson we will create a complete application from scratch that will allow us to CRUD a series of resources.  The app will accomplish the following User Stories:

* A user can have a list of animals they've seen
* A user can create a new animal
* A user can see the details of a new animal
* A user can delete an animal
* A user can update an animal
* A user can see their score

This App will make use of the `chalk` package and the `nanoid` packages from NPM.

## Steps to Succeed
Organizing thoughts and structuring the development process is crucial for building any software application. Before coding we need to have a deep understanding of our app's overall file strucutre.  

Each file has a purpose and it is important we udnerstand how these files will work together before moving to build.

[Our App Diagram](https://miro.com/welcomeonboard/QThEbzZvSW90WEFYdnZISHFXSk9VTmZlUk9qeU5QZnVSOENCdTE1VERWcnVEWjQ2Slc1YUpIRUEyQkE4cEdkVHwzMDc0NDU3MzY3NTczMzc0OTc2fDI=?share_link_id=870439321835)

Now with an understanding of our strucutre we can build our app using the following steps.

0. Install packages
1. ensure all functions and data are exported properly
2. import all functions to index.js
3. create NODE scripts to capture user input
4. create switch statement to control user flow
5. Build helper functions to read and write to our data
6. Build Read/Show functionality
7. Build Create functionality
9. Buld Delete functionality
8. Build Update functionality

## Command Line Crud

During this lesson we will create a complete application from scratch that will allow us to CRUD a series of resources.  The app will allow users to record a list of animals they've seen and record their points for each animal.

All Applications at their core perform the following actions in some way:

* Capture user input (the 'user' could be another application)
* Perform some sort of logic based on that input
* Interact with _some sort of database_
* Display new information to the user


The app will accomplish the following User Stories:

* A user can have a list of animals they've seen
* A user can create a new animal
* A user can see the details of a new animal
* A user can delete an animal
* A user can update an animal
* A user can see their score based on the animals they've stored in their DB

This App will make use of the [`chalk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk) package and the [`nanoid`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nanoid) packages from NPM.

**Note**: we are installing `chalk@4` and `nanoid@3`.  

## Steps to Succeed
Organizing thoughts and structuring the development process is crucial for building any software application. Before coding we need to have a deep understanding of our app's overall file strucutre.  

Each file has a purpose and it is important we udnerstand how these files will work together before moving to build.

[Our App Diagram](https://miro.com/welcomeonboard/QThEbzZvSW90WEFYdnZISHFXSk9VTmZlUk9qeU5QZnVSOENCdTE1VERWcnVEWjQ2Slc1YUpIRUEyQkE4cEdkVHwzMDc0NDU3MzY3NTczMzc0OTc2fDI=?share_link_id=870439321835)

Now with an understanding of our strucutre we can build our app using the following steps.

0. Install packages
1. ensure all functions and data are exported properly
2. import all functions to index.js
3. create NODE scripts to capture user input
4. create switch statement to control user flow
5. Build helper functions to read and write to our data
6. Build Read/Show functionality
7. Build Create functionality
9. Buld Delete functionality
8. Build Update functionality

# Collaborative Programming 5/23/23

## Agenda
* 7:00 - 7:05 Announcements 
* 7:05 - 7:30 Module 2 Comms Expectations
* 7:30 - 8:00 Pair Prorgramming Demo  
* 8:00 - 8:10 Break
* 8:10 - 9:00 Pair - Programming Debug Challenge 

## How To ask for Help 
1.  Greet the person you're asking poltiely.
2.  Describe what your are working on - what lab or project?
3.  Explain the *expected* behavior.
4.  Explain what the *current* behavior is.
5.  Explain what you've done to try to fix.
6.  Paste the code in a code block.

### Examples

Bad

    hey my function dont work
    

Better

    Hey, my function ins't working.  I'm not getting an error or console log.

```js 
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
        .then(response => {
            console.log('Response:', response);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error:', error);
    
  });
```
Pretty Good 
       
     Hey Gigi , having trouble with my `fetch` call.  I'm not seeing the an error message or a console.log.  Any ideas?
        
```js
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
        .then(response => {
            console.log('Response:', response);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error:', error);
    });
```
Best

     Hey Gigi and Tim.  My partner and I ran into an issue on the `fecth` function in our JSON lab.  
     Function 4 has us make a request to an external API and log the data or an error.
     We're not getting a console.log or an error logged. 
     We've double checked the api url and its good.
     We know the callbacks are correct.
     Here's our code:
 ```js
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
        .then(response => {
            console.log('Response:', response);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error:', error);
    });
```

## Reference Questions

### What does it mean to Pair Program?
Working hand in hand - one person drives - writes everything down.  
Other person navigates and gives tips to the driver - Emily Mohr

### What are the two roles in pair programming? What is the purpose of each role?

#### Role 1 
Driver - is the person who actually does the typing.  The driver usually is taking an easier time working on the code - they're doign the typing and the other person (navigator) is the one conceptually working things out


#### Role 2
Navigator - navigator guides the driver on what to do. 


### What are some of the benefits of pair programming? Think of as many as you can.

It's always good to have someone who can look over your code for errors;
Two minds > one.  Figuring out different ways to get to the solution; -  Brandon Harris

I've spent hours on coed eand ana tlooked it over and it was a comma - Tonesha Rose



### What do you think will be challenging about working in this style?

Everyone has different styles - your style might not be your partners style - Keith Camacho

People have different levels of understanding - Brandon Harris

### Why do you think Pursuit wants you to spend time pair programming?

Its beneficial for both parties - the teacher will benefit form reinforcing what they already know - the person who doesn't udnerstand LEARNs



### What is the Pomodoro technique?
A tehcnique designed for **time management**
Set a task for 25 min
Once its up - take a 5 min break

Repeat the process 
After Four take a 35 minute break

## Pair Programming Norms





## Pair Programming Activity

1.  We will randomly assign students into pairs. Each pair will consist of a "driver" and a "navigator."

2. Once the pairs are formed, decide who will be the driver and who will be the navigator. The driver will be responsible for writing the code, while the navigator will guide and assist the driver.

3.  Pairs will work together to debug a selected function from the `activity.js` file. The function will have intentional bugs.  Your task is to work through this together.  

4.  After 10 minutes, we will reconvene in the main classroom, discuss a solution for the functions and repeat the process with a _new random partner_

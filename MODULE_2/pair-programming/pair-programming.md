## Pair Programming Norms





## Pair Programming Activity

1.  We will randomly assign students into pairs. Each pair will consist of a "driver" and a "navigator."

2. Once the pairs are formed, decide who will be the driver and who will be the navigator. The driver will be responsible for writing the code, while the navigator will guide and assist the driver.

3.  Pairs will work together to debug a selected function from the `activity.js` file. The function will have intentional bugs.  Your task is to work through this together.  

4.  After 10 minutes, we will reconvene in the main classroom, discuss a solution for the functions and repeat the process with a _new random partner_

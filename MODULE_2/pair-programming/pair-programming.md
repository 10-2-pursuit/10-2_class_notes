# Collaborative Programming 5/23/23

## Agenda
* 7:00 - 7:05 Announcements 
* 7:05 - 7:30 Module 2 Comms Expectations
* 7:30 - 8:00 Pair Prorgramming Demo  
* 8:00 - 8:10 Break
* 8:10 - 9:00 Pair - Programming Debug Challenge 

## How To ask for Help 
1.  Greet the person you're asking poltiely.
2.  Describe what your are working on - what lab or project?
3.  Explain the *expected* behavior.
4.  Explain what the *current* behavior is.
5.  Explain what you've done to try to fix.
6.  Paste the code in a code block.

### Examples
     Bad
        hey my function dont work
    

    Better
        Hey, my function ins't working.  I'm not getting an error or console log.
```js 
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
        .then(response => {
            console.log('Response:', response);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error:', error);
    
  });
```
    Pretty Good 
        Hey Gigi , having trouble with my `fetch` call.  I'm not seeing the an error message or a console.log.  Any ideas?
        
```js
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
        .then(response => {
            console.log('Response:', response);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error:', error);
    });
```
    Best
     Hey Gigi and Tim.  My partner and I ran into an issue on the `fecth` function in our JSON lab.

     Function 4 has us make a request to an external API and log the data or an error.
     Here's our code:

    We're not getting a console.log or an error logged. 
    We've double checked the api url and its good.

    We know the callbacks are correct.
 ```js
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
        .then(response => {
            console.log('Response:', response);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error:', error);
    });
```

## Pair Programming Norms





## Pair Programming Activity

1.  We will randomly assign students into pairs. Each pair will consist of a "driver" and a "navigator."

2. Once the pairs are formed, decide who will be the driver and who will be the navigator. The driver will be responsible for writing the code, while the navigator will guide and assist the driver.

3.  Pairs will work together to debug a selected function from the `activity.js` file. The function will have intentional bugs.  Your task is to work through this together.  

4.  After 10 minutes, we will reconvene in the main classroom, discuss a solution for the functions and repeat the process with a _new random partner_

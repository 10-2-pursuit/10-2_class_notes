## Pair Activity
# Pair Programming Project: Building a Personal Website


In this pair programming project, you and your partner will work together to create a small website using HTML. The website will showcase information about both of you, including a brief introduction and an image. You'll also explore the use of semantic HTML tags to enhance the structure and meaning of the content.

## Project Requirements
1. Create an HTML file named `index.html`.
2. Start by adding the basic structure of an HTML document using the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration and `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
3. Inside the `<body>` tag, create a header section that includes a heading with the project title.
4. Create a section for each team member that includes the following:
   - Add a heading with your name and your partner's name.
   - Write a brief introduction about yourself and your partner using paragraphs (`<p>`).
   - Insert an image of yourself and your partner using the `<img>` tag. Ensure you have the image files ready and saved in the same directory as the HTML file.
5. Use semantic HTML tags to enhance the structure and meaning of the content. For example, you can use `<header>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` tags appropriately.

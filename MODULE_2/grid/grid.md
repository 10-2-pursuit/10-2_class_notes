### Key Terms

1. **Display**: The CSS `display` property specifies how an element should be rendered on the web page. It determines the type of box used for an element and how it interacts with other elements.

2. **Block**: Elements with a `display` value of `block` generate a block-level box. They start on a new line and occupy the full width available by default. Block-level elements can have dimensions (width, height) and can have margin, padding, and border properties.

3. **Inline**: Elements with a `display` value of `inline` generate an inline-level box. They do not start on a new line and only occupy the space necessary for their content. Inline-level elements do not have dimensions and do not accept margin, padding, or border properties.

4. **Inline-block**: Elements with a `display` value of `inline-block` combine features of both block and inline elements. They generate an inline-level box but can have dimensions (width, height) and accept margin, padding, and border properties. Inline-block elements flow inline with other content while retaining their block-like properties.

5. **Row**: The concept of rows is often associated with CSS grid or flexbox layouts. In CSS grid, rows are created by defining the grid container's `grid-template-rows` property. Rows contain grid items that can be placed in specific cells within the grid.

6. **Column**: Similarly to rows, columns are associated with CSS grid or flexbox layouts. In CSS grid, columns are created by defining the grid container's `grid-template-columns` property. Columns contain grid items that can be placed in specific cells within the grid.

These concepts are fundamental to understanding and controlling the layout and behavior of elements in CSS.

## Guiding questions

- What problem does `grid` attempt to solve?

- What property-value pair must you add to a parent element to have all of its children elements act as if they are in a grid?

- How do the CSS properties `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` affect the grid? Are they placed on the parent element or children element?

- Describe the following CSS and how it will affect each child element inside of the `container` element.

  ```css
  .container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 200px 100px 400px;
    grid-template-rows: 50px 300px 200px;
  }
  ```




  How might CSS Grid be used to help in the implementation of this page?

- Take a look at [this repl](https://replit.com/@Pursuit/CSS-Grid-Nested-Grid-Example) which makes use of a grid inside of another grid. Describe what is happening and how it works.

- Try adding the following CSS to the repl above.

  ```css
  .container.child {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  }
  ```

  How does this visually change the page? Why?

- How do you add gaps to your grid?

- How can you apply a minimum size to your grid elements?

        <li class="important-quote">The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish
            and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak
            through the valley of the darkness, for heis truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And
            I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy
            My brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon you.</li>

        <li>We've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on.</li>

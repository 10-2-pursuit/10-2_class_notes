        <span>- Dracula</span>
      </p>
    </div>

  - What CSS selector could you use to affect all paragraphs with a class of `movie-quote`?
  - What CSS selector could you use to affect any `active` element?
  - What CSS selector could you use to affect all `span` elements within an element with the `quotes` class?
  - What CSS selector could you use to affect both the `titanic` and `dracula` classes?

- What is a pseudo-class?
    - A pseudo-class is a selector that selects elements that are in a specific state, e.g. they are the first element of their type, or they are being hovered over by the mouse pointer.

- What selector would you use to style links when they are being hovered over?

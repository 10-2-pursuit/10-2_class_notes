// Recursion - what is it?

//  A function that calls itself until it does not

//  CALL THE FUNCTION AGAIN OR STOP - THATS IT - NO MORE NO LESS

//  Each recursive function has a BASE case and a REDUCTIVE CASE case

// the BASE case ENDS the funciton 
// the REDUCTIVE  case is moves the function towards the base case - IT KEEPS GOING 

// Happy new year
// lets use recursion to write a countdown function for the new year
// what data type is a function? 
    // a function is an objet

// when we make a recurssive function
    // each invocation of the funciton - each time we execute it
    // creates an OBJECT
    // space complexity increases; 
const happyNewYear = (num) => {
  // we need two cases
  // a BASE CASE that ENDS the funciton
  if (num === 0) {
    console.log('HAPPY NEW YEAR!#@!#!@')
  } else {
    // and a REDUCTIVE CASE that keeps the function going
    console.log(`...${num}`);
    happyNewYear(num - 2) // each function waits for this to end 
  }

// happyNewYear(10);

    // we are going to remove the top element of the array and add it to sum
        // then we keep going 
        
        // or we stop
        // default params are used if no val is passed

    // BASE - STOP

  /*
    Fibonacci is a classic problem that shows up as examples in coding or as a problem to solve in a class or possibly on an interview. Since sequence shows up often, it is worthwhile to take the time to gain a solid understanding what the Fibonacci Sequence is and how to calculate it.
    Write a function that prints the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence:
    1.  Do we understand the problem?
  
    
    
 
    2.  Restate the problem in your own words
    using the argument passed through we will add numbers in the fibo sequence to reach the end number in the sequecen

    3. Ask Clarifying questions

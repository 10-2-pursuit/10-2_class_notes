// What is a Data Structure?
    // it is the different ways a computer stores or accesses data

// What are some data structures we have used in JS thus far?
    // Arrays  => a special kind of object
    // Objects =>  a HASH map - special data strucutre that stores keys in a fancy way and sores values
    // Sets => unique collection of data - much like an array and sort of like an object
    // Map => much like a JS object - its a hash table - but keys can be ANYTHING

// IF we consider an array what are the individual properties of data in an array?
    // each item in an array is an element => 
        // think of this as an object 
    
const myArr = ["hello", "world", () => {}, 1];
    // if myArr[0] were an object - what would it look like?
        // myArr[0] could look like this => { data: "hello", index: 0 }
class Element {
    constructor(value, ind) {
        this.value = value;
        this.ind = ind;
    }
}

let myEl = new Element("sweet it works", 0);

// Every Data Structure needs a defined building block

// the convention for a Data Structures is to create a Class called Node;

// the first step when dealing with a data strucute is to design a Node;
    // not all classes in JS are declared with the class keyword
    // some people call this 'syntactic sugar' 

// the whole reason we do alllll this nonsense is to efficently store and retreive data
    // so every node needs DATA

    constructor(data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;

    Objectives:
    
    - Differentiate between a generic tree and binary search trees.
    - Identify why trees are valuable data structures for searching.
    - Represent a tree structure in JavaScript.
    - Describe code that searches  a tree.

//  *******  What are trees? **********
// It's a data structure; It NOT a linear data structure;
// meaning :  it goes from highest to lowest;
// and there is a parent/child dynamic
// we see this in places like React apps

// What is a parent component in a React app?
// App is a parent of our Index component - which COULD be a parent of our Show Page

//  What is a Linear Data strucutre?
// Linear is a Linked list - is unidirectional data structure;

//  Why would we use a tree over a linkedList?
// a tree is more efficent if its organized a certain way;
// if a tree is sorted we can VERY efficently search through it
// also - we can build in logic as to HOW our nodes (tree data) are sorted

// TREES VOCAB - STUFF YOU WILL FIND ON INTERVIEWS

// Node:  class TreeNode - we do this for consistency 
// - The fundamental part of a tree.
// - Represents a single data point or an element of the tree.
// - A tree typically starts with a single node, known as the root, from which all other nodes branch out.

// Root:
// - The topmost node of the tree.
// - The only node in a tree that doesn't have a parent.
// - All other nodes in the tree can be reached directly or indirectly from the root.

// Edge:
// - A link between two nodes.
// - Represents the relationship between parent and child nodes in the tree.

// Parent Node:
// - A node that has an edge to one or more nodes beneath it.
// - The node directly above any given node in the tree.

// Child Node:
// - A node that is directly connected to another node when moving away from the root.
// - A node directly below and connected to another node.

// Leaf Node:
// - A node with no children.
// - These are the external or terminal nodes of a tree.

// Subtree:
// - A portion of a tree that consists of a node and all its descendants.
// - A tree contained entirely within another tree.

// Depth of a Node:
// - The number of edges from the node to the tree's root node.
// - The root node has a depth of 0.

// Height of a Node:
// - The number of edges on the longest path from the node to a leaf.
// - The height of a tree is the height of its root node.

// Binary Tree:
// - A special type of tree where each node can have at most two children, often referred to as the left and right children.

// Balanced Tree:
// - A tree where no leaf is much farther away from the root than any other leaf.
// - This ensures that operations on the tree remain efficient.

// Traversal:
// - The process of visiting all the nodes in a tree in a specific order (like inorder, preorder, or postorder for binary trees).

// ***** Let's build out a Tree class *****

// before we do lets look at some models we may understand better;

/*   
    a common and powerful binary Tree is a BST or Binary Search Tree;
    Each node of a binary search tree is inserted to the right of its parent node if it is of greater value
    and to the LEFT of the parent node if it is of a lesser value.
    a BST has an average search() of O(log N) - however, the worst case scenario for a BST is actually O(N) - 
    this is just very, very rare

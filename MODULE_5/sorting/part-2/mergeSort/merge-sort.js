     ********  MERGE SORT  **********

    - Merge sort is an efficient sorting algorithm. 
    - It works on the principle of Divide and Conquer. 
    - Merge sort repeatedly breaks down a list into several sublists 
      until each sublist consists of a single element and merging 
      those sublists in a manner that results into a sorted list.
    - Starts by comparing every two elements and swapping them if the first item is less than the second. 
    - It then merges each of the resulting lists of two into 
      lists of four using the same comparison, then merges those lists of four, and so on; until at last two lists are merged into the final sorted list.

    - Merge sort is a fast, stable sort, meaning it will keep the   elements in original order in the case of duplicate or equal values.

    - Time complexity: O(n(logn)) N time to reassemble and log(n) to split;
    - Space is O(n) - one of its weaknesses.
    Merge sort is great in multi-threaded languages like Java
    as threads working side by side can sort the arrays while they are being split at once.

    DIVIDE AND CONQUER

      In CS, Divide and Conquer is a term used to describe a certain 
      paradigm for implementing algorithms.  Any algorithm that adheres
      to a Divide and Conquer methodology functions by breaking a problem down into a smaller version of the same problem.  This effect is repeated until a simple solution can be found.  The results are then recompiled to return a solution.



Merge sort by the numbers 

    Imagine we need to sort the following array:

    [4, 8, 7, 2, 11, 1, 3]

    1.  DIVIDE - Split the array in two
        
        [4, 8, 7, 2], [11, 1, 3]

    2.  Continue splitting until all arrays are SINGLE ELEMENTS

         [4, 8, 7, 2], [11, 1, 3]
            /   \          /  \
        [4, 8]  [7, 2] [11,1] [3]
          /\      /\        /\   \  
        [4] [8] [7] [2], [11] [1] [3]
        
    3. CONQUER - pushing the elements into a new array one by one

         [4], [8], [7], [2], [11], [1], [3]
            |          |          |     |
          [4, 8], [2, 7],  [1, 11] , [3]

    4.  Continue until we have one array
        [ 4, 8], [2, 7],  [1, 11], [3]
            \      |        |      /
          [2, 4, 7, 8], [1, 3, 11]
                |            |
            [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 11]

const testArr = [4, 8, 7, 2, 11, 1, 3];

//  Step one, lets build our CONQUER step for use later
//  once we have a DIVIDE step
const leftTest = [1, 4, 8];
const rightTest = [3, 6];

// [1, 3, 4, 6, 8]

const merge = (left, right) => { // left -[ 8] right - []
  // left -> [  8]
  // right -> []

  // where to begin?
  let sortedArray = [] // [1, 3, 4, 6]
  // create a new array

    while (left.length && right.length){ // true
      //create a loop that will run while we have elements in both our right and left arrays by checking the truthiness of the length
      if (left[0] < right[0]){  8 < 6
        // create a condition that looks at the first element of the left array
          sortedArray.push(left.shift())
        // if the value is smaller we want to push it into our array
      }else {
          sortedArray.push(right.shift())
          // else we want to push the right side into our new array
        }
      }

    return [...sortedArray, ...left, ...right]
  // return a new array with the values of our sorted array spread, followed by any remaining value that might be in the left or right array
};
  // console.log(leftTest, rightTest, merge(leftTest, rightTest))


// Step TWO DIVIDE
// now that we have a conquer function that merges
//
const simpleArray = [9, 1, 5]
// [9, 1] -> [9] [1]
// [5]



const mergeSort = (arr) => {
  //  now what?
  // BASE CASE 
    if (arr.length <= 1){
      return arr
    }
    // if the length of the array is less than or equal to 1 then we know our array is already sorted so we can return our array


  // REDUCTIVE CASE - an algorithm for transforming one problem into another simpler problem.
      const mid = Math.ceil(arr.length/2) // 1.5-> 2
    // find mid point of array by calling Math.ceil on half of the input array's length - remember find the median!
      let left = arr.splice(0, mid) // [9, 1]
    // create a variable to hold the value of the first half of the array that we will get by splicing up to our mid point
      let right = arr // [5]
    // create a variable to hold the value of the remainer of the array


    return merge(mergeSort(left), mergeSort(right))

    // return the result of our merge function called on the result of our mergeSort function called on the left and right of our array
};

console.log(mergeSort(testArr));
console.log(mergeSort(simpleArray));




//  ******** Array.prototype.sort() ********

/* lets sort these cards using .sort()
  from the MDN docs:
  The sort() method sorts the elements of an array in place 
  and returns the sorted array.  
  The default sort order is ascending, 
  built upon converting the elements into strings, 
  then comparing their sequences of UTF-16 code units values

  BUT we can pass a compareFunction as a callback.
  This compare function accepts two arguments and
   MUST return a number;
  IF the number is > 0 - the second argument first;
  IF the number is < 0 the first argument is sorted first;
  returning  0 keeps the original order;

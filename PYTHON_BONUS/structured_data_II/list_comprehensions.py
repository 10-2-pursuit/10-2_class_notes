# List Comprehensions
# Python is famous for allowing you to write code that’s elegant, easy to write, and almost as easy to read as plain English. One of the language’s most distinctive features is the list comprehension, which you can use to create powerful functionality within a single line of code. It is basically the equivalent of wrapping up the array methods filter and map while also allowing for nested loops!

# In this lesson, you’ll learn how to:
    # Rewrite loops and map() calls as a list comprehension in Python
    # Choose between comprehensions, loops, and map() calls
    # Supercharge your comprehensions with conditional logic
    # Use comprehensions to replace filter()
    # Populating lists in Python

# There are a few different ways you can create lists in Python. To better understand the trade-offs of using a list comprehension in Python, here are some other ways to create lists.

# Using for loops
# The most common type of loop is the for loop. You can use a for loop to create a list of elements in three steps:

    # Instantiate an empty list.
    # Loop over an iterable or range of elements.
    # Append each element to the end of the list.

# If you want to create a list containing the first ten perfect squares, then you can complete these steps in three lines of code:

squares = []
for i in range(10):
    squares.append(i**2)

print(squares)
# Prints [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]

# Here, the code instantiates an empty list named squares. Then, it uses a for loop to iterate over range(10). Finally, it calculates the square of the number and append the result to the end of the list.

# Using map()
# The built-in map() function provides an alternative approach that’s based in functional programming. You pass in a function and an iterable, and map() will create a "map object" that contains the values of the iterable passed through the function. You have to convert the "map object" to a list before you can do things like print it. (You can use the list() function to do that.)

# Here's an example of the previous code that uses the map() function, instead, to generate a list of the first ten perfect squares.

squares = map(lambda x: x**2, range(10))

print(list(squares))
# Prints [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
# This is a lot like the Array.map function from JavaScript.

# Using list comprehensions
# List comprehensions are a third way of making lists. With this elegant approach, you could rewrite the for loop from the first example in just a single line of code:

squares = [i**2 for i in range(10)]

print(list(squares))
# Prints [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]

# Rather than creating an empty list and adding each element to the end, you simply define the list and its contents at the same time by following this format:
new_list = [expression for member in iterable]
# Every list comprehension in Python includes those three elements:

    # expression is the member itself, a call to a method, or any other valid expression that returns a value. In the example above, the expression i**2 is the square of the member value.
    # member is the object or value in the list or iterable. In the example above, the member value is i.
    # iterable is a list, set, sequence, generator, or any other object that can return its elements one at a time. In the example above, the iterable is range(10).
# Because the expression requirement is so flexible, a list comprehension in Python works well in many places where you would use map() or a for loop.

# Benefits of using list comprehensions
# List comprehensions are often described as being more idiomatic Python than loops or map(). But rather than blindly accepting that assessment, it’s worth it to understand the benefits of using a list comprehension in Python when compared to the alternatives. Later on, you’ll learn about a few scenarios where the alternatives are a better choice.

# One main benefit of using a list comprehension in Python is that it’s a single tool that you can use in many different situations. In addition to standard list creation, list comprehensions can also be used for mapping and filtering. You don’t have to use a different approach for each scenario.

# This is the main reason why list comprehensions are considered idiomatic Python. Python embraces simple, powerful tools that you can use in a wide variety of situations, like the built-in len() method that gives you the length of strings, lists, sets, tuples, and lots of other things.

# List comprehensions are also more declarative than loops, which means many people find them easier to read and understand. Loops require you to focus on how the list is created. You have to manually create an empty list, loop over the elements, and add each of them to the end of the list. With a list comprehension in Python, you can instead focus on what you want to go in the list and trust that Python will take care of how the list construction takes place.

# Build your comprehension comprehension
# In order to understand the full value that list comprehensions can provide, it’s helpful to understand their range of possible functionality. You’ll also want to understand the changes that arrived in Python 3.8.

# Using conditional logic
# This is how you can filter values when creating the list with a comprehension.

# Earlier, you saw this formula for how to create list comprehensions:

new_list = [expression for member in iterable]

# While this description is accurate, it’s also a bit incomplete. A more complete description of the comprehension adds support for conditionals. The most common way to add conditional logic to a list comprehension is to add a conditional to the end of the expression:

new_list = [expression for member in iterable (if conditional)]
# Here, the conditional statement comes just before the closing bracket.

# Conditionals are important because they allow list comprehensions to filter out unwanted values.

sentence = 'the rocket came back from mars'
vowels = [c for c in sentence if c in 'aeiou']

print(vowels)
# Prints ['e', 'o', 'e', 'a', 'e', 'a', 'o', 'a']
# Remember that strings are iterable. When you use them in a list comprehension like this (the in sentence part), the list comprehension loops through each character in the value sentence and sets c to each one. Then, the conditional statement filters out any characters in sentence that aren’t a vowel.

# The conditional can test any valid expression. If you need a more complex filter, then you can even move the conditional logic to a separate function:

sentence = 'Mary, Mary, quite contrary, how does your garden grow?'
def is_consonant(letter):
    vowels = "aeiou"
    return letter.isalpha() and letter.lower() not in vowels

consonants = [i for i in sentence if is_consonant(i)]

print(consonants)
# Prints ['M', 'r', 'y', 'M', 'r', 'y', 'q', 't', 'c',
# 'n', 't', 'r', 'r', 'y', 'h', 'w', 'd', 's', 'y',
# 'r', 'g', 'r', 'd', 'n', 'g', 'r', 'w']
# Here, the programmer created a complex filter is_consonant() and passes this function as the conditional statement for the list comprehension. Note that the member value i is also passed as an argument to the function.

# You can place the conditional at the end of the statement for simple filtering, but what if you want to change a member value instead of filtering it out? In this case, it’s useful to place the conditional near the beginning of the expression:

new_list = [expression (if conditional) for member in iterable]
# With this formation, you can use conditional logic to select from multiple possible output options. For example, if you have a list of prices, then you may want to replace negative prices with 0 and leave the positive values unchanged:

original_prices = [1.25, -9.45, 10.22, 3.78, -5.92, 1.16]
prices = [i if i > 0 else 0 for i in original_prices]

print(prices)
# Prints [1.25, 0, 10.22, 3.78, 0, 1.16]
# Here, the expression i contains a conditional statement, i if i > 0 else 0 which is similar to JavaScript's ternary operator, i > 0 ? i : 0. This tells Python to output the value of i if the number is positive, but to change i to 0 if the number is negative. If this seems overwhelming, then it may be helpful to view the conditional logic as its own function:

def get_price(price):
    return price if price > 0 else 0
prices = [get_price(i) for i in original_prices]

print(prices)
# Prints [1.25, 0, 10.22, 3.78, 0, 1.16]
# Now, the conditional statement is contained within get_price(). You can use functions like that as part of your list comprehension expression.

# When not to use list comprehensions
# List comprehensions are useful and can help you write elegant code that’s easy to read and debug, but they’re not the right choice for all circumstances. They might make your code run more slowly or use more memory. If your code is less performant or harder to understand, then it’s probably better to choose an alternative.

# Comprehensions can be nested to create combinations of lists, dictionaries, and sets within a collection. Nested lists are a common way to create matrices, which are often used for mathematical purposes. Take a look at the code block below:

matrix = [[i for i in range(5)] for _ in range(6)]

print(matrix)
# Prints
# [
#     [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
#     [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
#     [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
#     [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
#     [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
#     [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
# ]
# The outer list comprehension [... for _ in range(6)] creates six rows, while the inner list comprehension [i for i in range(5)] fills each of these rows with values.

# So far, the purpose of each nested comprehension is pretty intuitive. However, there are other situations, such as flattening nested lists, where the logic arguably makes your code more confusing. Take this example, which uses a nested list comprehension to flatten a matrix:

matrix = [
    [0, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 1],
    [2, 2, 2],
]
flat = [num for row in matrix for num in row]

print(flat)
# Prints [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]
# The code to flatten the matrix is concise, but it may not be so intuitive to understand how it works.

# While the single-line nested list comprehension might seem more idiomatic Python, what’s most important is to write code that your team can easily understand and modify. When you choose your approach, you’ll have to make a judgment call based on whether you think the comprehension helps or hurts readability.

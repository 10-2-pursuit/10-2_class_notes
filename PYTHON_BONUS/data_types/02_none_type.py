# Where JavaScript has both the null and undefined values that can imply the lack of existence of a value, Python only has one.

# In Python there is a value called None, which represents the absence of a value. None is the only value of the NoneType data type. Just like the Boolean True and False values, None must be typed with a capital N.

# This value-without-a-value can be helpful when you need to store something that wonâ€™t be confused for a real value in a variable. One place where None is used is as the return value of functions that do not explicitly return a value, much in the same way that JavaScript will return undefined for functions that do not return a value.

# Behind the scenes, Python adds return None to the end of any function definition with no return statement. Also, if you use a return statement without a value (that is, just the return keyword by itself), then None is returned.

# Types of numbers
# In JavaScript there was just one numeric type, Number. However, Python distinguishes between three numeric types.

# Integer
# Counting numbers, both positive and negative, are called integers. They have no decimal point.

# Unlike JavaScript, integers in Python are a different type of number than decimals, they are fundamentally a different kind of in-memory representation.

# Integers are created by a literal number with no decimal point or through the use of the int() constructor.

print(3)         # => 3
print(int(19))   # => 19
print(int())     # => 0
# Interesting fact: Boolean is a subtype of integer in Python.



# Floating point number
# The decimal numbers in Python are called floating point numbers. The precision (number of decimal places) and internal representation (how they are stored) can change slightly depending on the machine on which your program is running. Very rarely does this have any effect unless you are doing extremely precise work (as in certain scientific fields).

# "Floating point number"... that's a weird term. That's because the decimal point "floats" based on how many digits come before the decimal point, it floats around the number, sometimes at position 1 for some numbers (.123), and sometime at position 7 for some numbers (123456.38).

# While you may not have experienced it yet, floating point numbers are known to have the occasional rounding error. Open up Node.js and try evaluating the expression "4.1 - 3". Open up Python and try the same thing. That's because of the way "floating point numbers" are stored in memory, they are prone to this type of rounding error.

# Floating point numbers are created using numbers with a decimal point, with the float() constructor, or using scientific notation.

# print(2.24)      # => 2.24
# print(2.)        # => 2.0
# print(float())   # => 0.0
# print(27e-5)     # => 0.00027


# Complex numbers
# Complex numbers consist of a real part and an imaginary part. In mathematics this is often written as 5 + 7i where 5 is the real part and 7 is the imaginary part. In programming the i is often switched to a j. Python follows this pattern also.

# The imaginary part of a complex number can be specified by appending j or J to a number (which makes an imaginary part with zero real part). Complex numbers are created by adding a real part to an imaginary part or using the complex() constructor. If omitted, the imaginary part defaults to zero.

print(7j)              # => 7j
print(5.1+7.7j)     # => 5.1+7.7j
print(complex(3, 5))    # => 3+5j
print(complex(17))     # => 17+0j
print(complex())       # => 0j
# Fun fact: Both the real part and the imaginary part of a complex number are stored as floating point numbers.

# While it is unlikely you will use complex numbers, the seamless integration of complex numbers in Python is one of many reasons a development team with math on their minds would choose to use this language.

# Type casting
# When once type of number is converted to another, the process used is called type casting. It is performed using built-in functions for each type.

# Example 1: Type-cast float to integer using float
print(17)               # => 17
print(float(17))        # => 17.0

# Example 2: Type-cast float to integer using int
print(17.0)             # => 17.0
print(int(17.0))        # => 17

# Example 3: Type-cast float or integer to string using str
print(str(17.0) + ' and ' + str(17))        # => 17.0 and 17

# The output from print sometimes looks the same for strings and numbers. However, without type casting you would receive an error when trying to do this concatenation with the string and.

# For example
print(17.0 + ' and ' + 17)
# results in `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'float' and 'str'``

# Arithmetic operators
# These operators are the same in JavaScript and Python
    # + (addition)
    # - (subtraction)
    # * (multiplication)
    # / (division)
    # % (modulo)

# Python includes two other useful operators for common arithmetic expressions
    # ** (exponent)
    # // (integer division)

# One of the interesting idiomatic quirks of reading Python is that a lot of code does not put spaces around arithmetic operators and their operators. You will often see code in Python like this
    # print(num+1)

# whereas in JavaScript, the style is
    # print(num + 1)

# This really only applies to arithmetic operators.

# Exponentiation
# Multiplying a number, a, by itself a certain number of times, b, is written in Python as a**b. In mathematics, this is known as exponentiation. Sometimes, you will hear this expression referred to as "a to the power of b" or "a to the b power".

# Some examples include

print(2**3)        # => 8
print(5.5**15)     # => 127479497357.65536
print(10**30)      # => 1000000000000000000000000000000
print(10.0**30)    # => 1e+30
# Notice that when integer numbers get large, they stay integer numbers. However, a floating point number switches to scientific notation.

# Even very large integers are not a problem for Python. The official documentation says "Integers have unlimited precision."

# For example, the output of print(10**100) is

# 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 0000000000000

# On the other hand, floating point numbers eventually run out of memory and throw an error. For example, just by adding a .0, you'll find print(10.0**100) outputs OverflowError: (34, 'Result too large').


# Integer division with remainders
# Remember modulo (%) gives the remainder that results from a division.

# The // operator gives the other part of that division. This is the equivalent to the floor of the answer.

# For example

print(47 // 8)         # => 5
print(47 % 8)          # => 7
# Means that in long division 47 divided by 8 is 5 with remainder 7.

# In programming terms, the // operator provides a quick way to divide numbers and round down.

# When floating point numbers are used with integer division or modulo, the result will also be a floating point number

print(47.0 // 8.0)     # => 5.0
print(47.0 % 8.0)      # => 7.0

# Complex numbers cannot be used with integer division or modulo; rather, they throw errors.

print(complex(47) // 8)     # => TypeError: can't take floor of complex number.
print(complex(47) % 8)      # => TypeError: can't mod complex numbers.


# Assignment shorthand
# Like Javascript, Python supports shorthand operators for modifying a variable's value. As you probably guessed, all arithmetic operators have corresponding shorthand equivalents.

# += (addition)
# -= (subtraction)
# *= (multiplication)
# /= (division)
# %= (modulo)
# **= (exponentiation)
# //= (integer division)

# Notice: The ++ and -- operators don't exist in Python. Instead, Python uses += and -= only. This was a design decision by the Python team for simplicity and consistency.

# Structured Data

# Sequences
# The most basic data structure in Python is a sequence. Each item in a sequence is assigned an index and this index determines the order of the sequence. The first index is zero.

# You are already familiar with the text sequence type str, a.k.a. strings. The three basic sequence types you'll study in this lesson are list, tuple and range.

# Collections
# Collections are unordered data structures. Instead of indexes, collections use hashable values. In simple terms, a hashable value never changes during its lifetime. Since hashable values may be compared to determine equality, they are usable as a key in a dictionary or as the member of a set. You'll study dictionaries and sets in this lesson.

# Iterable
# An iterable can be thought of as the generic name for a sequence or collection. Specifically, an iterable is any object on which a loop can run (a.k.a. iterate over) to access the elements in the item.

# Immutable
# Iterables come in two forms: mutable and immutable. In short, mutable iterators can be modified or changed and immutable ones are frozen (similar to constants) so cannot be changed.

# Common actions for sequences include

# Checking for the presence of an item: if x in mylist
# Looping: for x in mylist
# Adding: [1,2,3] + [4,5,6]
# Multiplying ('am','pm') * 3
# Mutable sequences have additional actions like

# Adding items: append
# Removing items: remove
# Ordering: sort, reverse
# Splicing (a.k.a. partial replacements): splice
# Any function which modifies an iterable (that is, from the second list) will throw an error if you try to run it on an immutable object.

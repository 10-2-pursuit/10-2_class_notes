# Is Palindrome

## Problem 

Write a  function `isPalindrome` that takes a string as input and returns `true` if the string is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

For example, the strings "racecar" and "Madam" are palindromes, while "hello" and "OpenAI" are not.


## Testing

To test your function, _**navigate to the algorithms directory**_ and run:

```
npm install

npm test isPalindrome.test.js
```

## Solutions

### Two Pointer (iterative)

#### The Two-Pointer Technique

The two-pointer technique is a common approach used in algorithmic problem-solving, particularly when dealing with arrays, linked lists, or strings. It involves using two pointers or indices to traverse the data structure simultaneously, often from different ends or at different speeds, to perform certain operations efficiently.

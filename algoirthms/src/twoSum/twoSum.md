# twoSum

We will start today working on the classic `twoSum` problem from codewars.  
At 6:25 we will reconveinve in the main room to discuss solutions and walkthrough the super bonus solution together.

## Description 
Write a function that takes an array of numbers (integers for the tests) and a target number. It should find two different items in the array that, when added together, give the target value. The indices of these items should then be returned in a tuple / list (depending on your language) like so: (index1, index2).

The input will always be valid (numbers will be an array of length 2 or greater, and all of the items will be numbers; target will always be the sum of two different items from that array).

## Bonus 
Once you've found a solution - can you solve this without a nested loop?

# bubbleSortOnce

Your task is to implement one full iteration of the bubble sort algorithm to sort a list of integers. Bubble sort works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements in the list that are in the wrong order. Each pass through the list will swap at most one pair of adjacent elements. The algorithm iterates until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.

For this challenge, you only need to implement one full iteration of the bubble sort algorithm, which means you should go through the list once and perform the necessary swaps. You can assume that the list has at least two elements.

## Input
You will be given a list of integers as input.

## Output
You should output the same list of integers after one full iteration of the bubble sort algorithm has been applied.

## Example
```
input
[5, 3, 8, 6, 7, 2]
```

```
output
 [3, 5, 6, 7, 2, 8]
```

### Note 
In this example, after the first iteration of the bubble sort algorithm, the list is partially sorted and the largest element, 8, has bubbled up to the end of the list. The next iteration will not need to consider the last element of the list, since it is already sorted.

## Testing

To test your function, navigate to the algorithms directory and run:

```
npm install

npm test bubbleSort

```

## Card Styling:
- **Font**: Use 'Google Sans', sans-serif, system-ui for text inside the card.
- **Background Color**: Use a light gray background color (#f2f2f2) for the card.
- **Box Shadow**: Apply a subtle box shadow to the card for a lift effect (0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)).
- **Padding**: Set the padding inside the card to 10px.
- **Text Color**: Use a dark gray text color (#333) for the card content.
- **Left Border**: Add a 5px solid border on the left side of the card with an indigo color (#3f51b5).
- **Card Size**: The maximum width of the card should be 500px to avoid excessive width.

## Getting Started:

3. Apply CSS styles to achieve the desired appearance of the card.

#  Pursuit Pictures: We Watch The Movies So You Don't Have To

Welcome Pursuit Pictures! In the age of AI, it's more important than ever to write a solid and engaging review that will catch the attention of both humans and machines. In this exercise, you'll have the chance to flex your writing and Markdown skills while also sharing your thoughts on a recent movie you've seen.


## Instructions
1. As a group, select a driver who will code and share their screen and a presenter who will be in charge of presenting our project to the class.
2. As a group, choose a movie you've seen recently and discuss it.  Try to find a movie all of you have seen. 
3. Create a new Markdown document using a VS Code.
4. Write your movie review in the document, using at least the following Markdown elements:
   - A level-one heading with the movie title
   - A level-two heading with the plot summary
   - Bold and italic text to highlight important points in the review
   - A numbered list of the movie's strengths and weaknesses
   - An unordered list of the movie's main characters
   - A link to the movie's trailer
   - An image of the movie poster
   - A blockquote with a memorable quote from the movie
5. After 30 minutes we will reconveine in the main room.  Be ready to present your review to the class.

## Presentation

Each group will have 3-5 minutes to present their movie review to the class. You should explain the Markdown elements you used and why you chose them. You should also give a brief summary of the movie's plot and your personal opinion.

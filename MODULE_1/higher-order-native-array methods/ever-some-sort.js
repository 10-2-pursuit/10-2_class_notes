A lil' review 

- What is a higher order function?

- What is a native array method?

- What does it mean for a function to produce side effects?

- What does it mean for a function to return a value?

- Is it possible for functions that return values to also produce side effects?

- What is a callback function?

 //  Lets declare some functions before we dive into the lesson

// every()  - what is it and why do we use it?
    // what does the name tell us?
    

// The `.every()` method expects at least one argument. What data type is this argument?

// The `.every()` method's callback function has up to three parameters. What are these parameters?

// some() - what is it and why do we use it?
    // what does the name tell us?

// - How does the `.some()` method differ from the `.every()` method? How is it similar?
  
    



// sort()

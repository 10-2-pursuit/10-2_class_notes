## Flex time
For those of you who have completed your one on one already or finish during tomorrow's class we recommend working through  [Free Code Camp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/) responsive web design sessions.  Feel free to work in pairs!
While not mandatory, these sessions are a great precursor to the new content we'll be covering in Module 2.

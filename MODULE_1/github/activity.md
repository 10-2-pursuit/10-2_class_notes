# Real New Yorkers 

## Overview

Hey, you guys! Are you looking for an opportunity to tell the world what you really think of the greatest city in the world? Then listen up, because this is the activity for you!

In this group project, you'll be paired up with a bunch of other New Yorkers, and together you'll be creating a brand-new repository on GitHub, dedicated to rating the best and the worst of this town. You'll be collaborating on a Markdown file where you can share your thoughts on the best slice in Brooklyn, the worst tourist traps in Times Square, and everything in between.

So put on your Yankees cap, lace up those Tim's, grab a dollar slice, and join us for this one-of-a-kind adventure. Because nobody knows this town better than a real old-school New Yorker like you!

## Instructions

1. In your groups - decide who is the `driver`.
2. Your breakout room will contain a `topic` for each group.  
2. The driver will navigate to their `Github` page and create a new repository on GitHub for their team's `topic`.
4. Within the repository, create a new `Markdown` (.md) file with the name of their topic.
5. Together as a group add the following to your markdown
    * A main `header` with an `image` that is relevant to your groups topic
    * An `unordered list` of each group members name
    * A `Sub Header` for Each group members name
6. Next, each member of the group should `clone the repository` onto their own machine.
7. Each group member will `create a new branch` in the repository.
8. Each group member will add their own `paragraph under their individual heading` detaling their choice of the topic.
9. Once they have made their changes, each member should `commit and push` their changes to their individual branch and create a `pull request`.
### Bonus
The final step in the process of working with `git` and `github` is integrating the changes our colleagues made.  

This is known as `merging`

Together as a grouup - see if you can successfully `merge` the pull requests made by your teammates.  If your group successfully `merges` the new code, have each group member navigate to their own `local repository` and `pull` the changes.

This activity will allow you to work collaboratively on GitHub and get hands-on experience with branching, committing, and merging changes. It also allows for creativity and engagement with your group's chosen topic.

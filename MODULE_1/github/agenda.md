## Quick Git Reference

### Key Terms
- What is `git` - why do we use `git`?
"A secondary placewhere we can keep code that we are still working on && collaborating on" - Brandon H
it's a `version control` - it controls what state our code is in at a certain time and it lets us revert to that state

"In case of mistakes" - E Mohr
we use git to allow us to revert BACK to a safe place in our code
additionally it allows us to control the state of code when many different devs are working on it

- What is `github`? how are they different? 
'Github is a platofrm that lets other works together on a project' - Elisaul Batista
Is a website where we can all share and mutually access git repositories;
We use GH in developement to organize and share git;
- What is a `commit`?
A commit is when we 'save' our local git repository and update the code;
- What is a `branch`?
a branch is a parellel copy of the same code 
in this code we can track any work we wanna do without changing the code of the 'main'
each Github repo has either a 'master' or a 'main' branch that represents the MAIN branch
- What is a `local branch`?
Local - means only on my machine;  SO a local branch is only available on my machine- not on github
- What is a `local remote branch`?
Local branch that was pushed to the github repo;
ex: If Emily owns the repo and Dwayne is working on a branch locally - he can push his local and it will create a branch up on github under Emily's project;

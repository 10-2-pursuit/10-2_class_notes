# App Planning

This pre-reading will go over three different planning activities.

- Organizing features via user stories and cards on Trello
- Wireframes
- ERDs (Entity Relationship Diagrams)

**Note:** Since there are a few new concepts that are quite visual, here are some (optional) videos to introduce these topics.

**Second note:** Both of these videos are associated with specific tools. You do not need to use these tools, or sign up for these tools in order to watch the videos.

## Introduction

So far in this program, you've been building applications primarily for yourself. Put another way, the _reason_ you may have been building particular features has been for your edification. As part of this learning process, it is normal for your creative process to be a bit chaotic.

However, it's now time to shift away from that chaotic creation and instead focus on being extremely thoughtful in how you plan your applications. It's also important to begin thinking of applications that are for expressly for other people and customers. This means keeping your user in mind, first and foremost, which may or may not be you.

Applications that you use regularly likely have entire teams of people dedicated to anticipating your wants and needs. When you think of applications that you love to use, your favorites likely have the following in common:

- They are easy to navigate
- They are reliable and sensibly organized
- They are organized in such a way that their new features are intuitive and easy to discover
- They are designed to look aesthetically pleasing
- They are responsive to different types of devices and screens

In this lesson, you'll learn a few ways that your planning process can help create this kind of experience for your users.

Each topic, user stories, wireframes and ERDs are broken into separate markdown files.

## Choosing your tools

There are many tools out there and the features and pricing they have is always changing. Your primary focus is to build an application, so it's important to do very basic things that help you get set up.

Choosing a simpler tool will have the lowest learning curve, which will let you focus on the task, rather than learning the tool. If you already are familiar with a tool and have access to it, you can use it.

If you have further interest in developing your knowledge and skills on a particular tool, make sure you set up time in a way that is not blocking to your team's progress. You also have time after the project is complete.

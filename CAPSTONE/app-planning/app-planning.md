# App Planning Lesson Notes

## Learning Objectives

- Explain the utility of a user story
- Create user stories, using a simple template
- Explain the utility of wireframes
- Draw a simple wireframe by hand or with a simple tool
- Explain what an ERD is and how it relates to databases/database relations
- Explain what an entity is
- Explain what an entity relationship is
- Be able to identify a few common relationships between entities
- Be able to draw a simple ERD by hand or with a simple tool
- Review and explain what MVP is and how it fits into the product building process with these new tools

## Guiding Questions

- What order makes the most sense as far as planning when it comes to wireframes, user stories and ERDs?
- What kinds of problems can be avoided by taking the time to plan and use these tools?
- What is the value of low fidelity/simple diagrams? Does it make sense to skip simple ones and go for very robust ones right away?
- Why is it important to start with a mobile-first view/wireframe?

## Activities

### Activity 1

Spend 5-10 minutes as a class creating user stories for a grocery list app. Someone should be the note-taker for this activity

- Imagine it is just one grocery list
- Next imagine many grocery lists can be created
- Next image there are users and users can hae many grocery lists
- Next imagine if users want to share grocery lists with other users
- Are items their own entity? Why or why not?

Share this list over slack, so everyone can have it for the next activity.

### Activity 2

What views are needed to create the groceries app?

Break into groups to create views (and list the expected RESTful route for this view) either on paper (take photo with phone and upload to share) or with a simple app

Here are some example views:

- log in
- sign up
- user profile
- grocery lists
- grocery list
- new grocery item

The views should match the user stories identified below, as a class share each group's wireframe and talk about the design decisions

### Activity 3

As a class, create an ERD for the grocery app. It can be done with an app or on a whiteboard. Be sure to discuss design decisions along the way.

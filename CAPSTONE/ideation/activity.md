Write down the following questions

- What is this product's vision?
- Who is the target customer?
- What customer problem does it solve?
- Why is this problem important?
- What were customers doing before the product existed?
- How does this product compare to the alternatives?

Submit your answer to the class slack, so that everyone gets a chance to share their work. Choose 1-2 groups to discuss their case study.
